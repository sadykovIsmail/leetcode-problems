Quick Steps

1. Understand the problem

Input / Output / Constraints

2. Think Algorithm

Break into plain English steps

Identify loops, conditions, and data structures


3. Write Pseudocode

Use structured “fake code”

Focus on logic, not syntax


4. Dry Run

Test pseudocode manually with small examples

5. Translate to JS

Function → Loops → Conditions → Return → Test
